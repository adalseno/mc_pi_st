# Simple Monte Carlo simulation in Streamlit
[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://adalseno-mc-pi-st-app-z0t5o2.streamlit.app/)

Simple app to show a Monte Carlo simulation in Streamlit to cumpute $\pi$.<br>


The range goes from 100 to 1,000,000 iterations. Up to 100,000 the result is immediatley shown. For 1,000,000 it takes a bllink. For 10,000,000, thanks to numba, it takes a few seconds. Each simualtion is based on 100 trials.
